### Rules to get started

* Create or take an issue
* Open a pull request and change the version in `setup.py`
* Choose an odd number for versioning since odd releases will be used for test.
* Even releases will be made at the end of the dev/feature cycle and will be the stable
release for that particular cycle
* Add appropriate tags in all PRs/issues
